# Collaborative Editor Test Instructions

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Mouse Pointer Tracking
- Real-time mouse position broadcasting via Socket.IO
- Throttled mouse tracking (50ms) for smooth performance
- Mouse position updates sent to all connected users

### 2. Improved Text Cursor Positioning
- Better cursor position calculation and coordinate conversion
- Real-time cursor position updates with timestamps
- Enhanced cursor positioning with fallback support

### 3. Live Mouse Cursors with User Names
- Enhanced visual representation of user cursors
- Colored mouse pointers with user names
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Distinct colors for each user (HSL color system)

### 4. Optimized Real-time Synchronization
- Improved active users management
- Better user join/leave handling
- Enhanced socket event handling with error recovery

## How to Test

### Starting the Application
1. Backend: `cd backend && npm run dev` (runs on port 5000)
2. Frontend: `cd frontend && npm run dev` (runs on port 5173/5174)

### Testing Collaboration Features
1. Open multiple browser windows/tabs
2. Navigate to the same document
3. Login with different users
4. Observe:
   - Real-time text editing synchronization
   - Live text cursors with user names
   - Mouse pointers moving in real-time
   - User presence indicators

### Key Components Enhanced

#### Backend (`server.js`)
- Added `mouse-position` event handler
- Enhanced `cursor-position` with timestamp
- Improved active users management
- Better user join/leave notifications

#### Frontend Components
- **`useSocket.js`**: Added mouse position tracking
- **`Editor.jsx`**: Enhanced cursor/mouse visualization
- **`EditorPage.jsx`**: Integrated mouse tracking handlers

### Visual Features
- **Text Cursors**: Vertical blinking cursors with user names
- **Mouse Pointers**: Circular pointers with user names
- **Color Coding**: Each user gets a unique color
- **Smooth Animations**: Transitions for cursor movements
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes

## Expected Behavior
1. Users see each other's text cursors while typing
2. Mouse movements are tracked and displayed in real-time
3. User names appear above cursors and pointers
4. Different colors distinguish different users
5. Smooth transitions when users move around the document

## Technical Details
- Mouse tracking throttled to 50ms for performance
- Cursor tracking throttled to 100ms for balance
- HSL color system for user identification
- Socket.IO for real-time communication
- Fallback mechanisms for connectivity issues
